# Delay effects

Delay-line effects are not only extremely common in music production, but also rather easy to implement digitally compared to analog counterparts.

## Effects to implement

Based on readings from 'Audio Effects: Theory, Implementation, and Application' by Joshua D. Reiss and Andrew P. McPherson, I want to focus on implementing the following delay-line effects:

- [ ] Basic feedback delay
- [ ] Vibrato
- [ ] Flanger
- [ ] Chorus

Based on readings for the vibrato effect, I believe I can repurpose the vibrato effect for a tape-simulation effect that implements 'wow' and 'flutter' effects. Combined with distortion and noise, I could potentially create a convincing-sounding tape simulation effect for my own use.
