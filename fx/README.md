# fx

`fx` is an audio DSP library for building audio effects, made mostly for education and trying out DSP algorithms.

## Contents

`fx` contains algorithms and building blocks for the following audio effects:

- Biquad filter for common filtering effects
- DC filter for correcting DC offset
- Delay line structs for implementing delay line effects (feedback delay, chorus, flanger, vibrato)
- Digital-domain effects, like bitcrushing
- Classic digital reverbs and their fundamental filter buliding blocks
- Halfband filters for upsampling & downsampling
- Distortion waveshaper algorithms

## Credits

Any code or algorithms that I did not originally author is commented with proper credits. When this project is finished, I'll make a list of credits for each specific effect.
