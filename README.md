## about

`fx` is an ongoing project for **building and documenting realtime audio effects**, and maybe other things if i have time!

i'm writing articles about my development & learning process on my [website](https://www.renzomledesma.me/writing/fx). for a closer look at how to use `fx`, check out my first multi-effect plugin [croaker](https://github.com/renzol2/croaker)! üê∏

this repo contains the following:

### the crate, `fx`

`fx` is a Rust crate which contains DSP functions and building blocks for making basic audio effects.

### example plugins

i've implemented a collection of basic plugins implemented using [`nih-plug`](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) to implement and integrate `fx` as VST3/CLAP plugins, which include

- digital effects in `bitcrush`
- chorus/flanger effect in `chorus`
- basic feedback delay in `delay`
- several waveshaper distortion algorithms in `distortion`
- biquad filter implementation in `equalizer`
- classic digital reverb effects in `reverb`
- stereo vibrato effect in `vibrato`

this project began in fulfillment of the senior capstone requirement for the [Computer Science + Music degree program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://music.illinois.edu/admissions/undergraduate-programs-and-application/undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-science-cs-music/).
